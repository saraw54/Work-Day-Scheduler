# Work-Day-Scheduler
User functionality:
When opened, the user sees the current date and a planner including times from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., an input box for to-do list and a save button that will allow them to save tasks so that they are visible on refresh.

Throughout the course of the day, the past, current and future hours will change color for easy visible accessibility.
